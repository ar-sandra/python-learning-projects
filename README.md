# Python Learning Projects

This repository is my **Python learning portfolio** — a collection of beginner to intermediate projects created while practicing core programming concepts.

Each project focuses on a specific Python skill, such as:
- Basic arithmetic formatting
- Time calculations
<!-- Data Cleaning & Analysis
- Web Scraping Automation
- Text Processing with NLP -->


**Purpose:**  
To track my progress in Python, demonstrate practical applications of what I've learned, and serve as a reference for future development work.

##The arithmetic formatter
This program arranges arithmetic problems in the format we would write them manually.

**Example:**
23 + 45 = 68
output:
```
  23
+ 45
----
  68
```

##Time calculator project
This program takes in the start time and the time you want to add, and then gives back the new time.  
If there’s a day change, it shows that too!

**Example:**
'10:10 PM', '3:30'

output: 1:40 AM (next day)


<!-- Data Cleaning & Analysis
Processed and cleaned raw datasets using Pandas and NumPy.
Generated descriptive statistics and visual insights using Matplotlib and Seaborn.


- Web Scraping Automation
Built Python scripts with Requests and BeautifulSoup to extract product data from e-commerce sites.
Used Regex for text parsing and data formatting before exporting to CSV.

- Text Processing with NLP
Applied NLTK and spaCy for tokenization, lemmatization, and sentiment analysis on textual datasets.
Automated preprocessing steps to improve efficiency of text analysis workflows. -->
